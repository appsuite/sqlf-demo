This sample application was originally developed to go along with SQLFire post [Increasing performance and scalability of Web Applications using SQLFire](http://blogs.vmware.com/sqlfire/2012/05/increase-performance-and-scalability-of-existing-applications-using-sqlfire.html) on VMware vFabric blog. 

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the ease of integration SQLFire database into your current solution to gain performance while continuing to support current database.

While the specific performance metrics of an in-memory or relational databases can depend on many variables, this demo aims to focus on the relative performance gains in a generic Web application while in the same time illustrating the value-add benefits of SQLFire in your solution:

  * Scale-out data-tier enablement
  * Real-time Cloud-scale data synchronization support
